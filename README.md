## Getting started

### Install Rust toolchain

To build, first install the Rust toolchain. While the toolchain may be
installable from a package management system depending on your platform, it
currently is best to install via [rustup][1]. Please visit [www.rustup.rs][1]
to download and run the installer.

suite succeeds:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/siminau/sasd.git
$ cd sasd
$ cargo test
```

This will run all unit, integration, and doc tests.
